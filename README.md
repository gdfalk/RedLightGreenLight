# Red Light/Green Light

###by Graham Falk

***Starting the game:***
  
  Load up the file and hold a light above the breadboard. 
  The game starts in red light so stay still while it's loading.
  
***Playing the game:***
  
  Once the light changes to *green* for the first time then you may move. 
  Once it changes back to *red* you must stay still.
  If you make it all the way to the breadboard you must push the button while the light is *green* to win the game.
  If you move while the light is *red* then you lose the game.
  
***Restarting the game:***
  
  Once you either win or lose, you must completely re-run the program. 
  This will give you time to get set up again.
  
***Video Demonstration:***
